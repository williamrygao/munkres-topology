All solutions are my own. Try your hand at the exercises before viewing my solutions. The hardest part of any problem is readying yourself to answer it (well maybe not ANY problem, but at least the problems in this book). Sail forbidden seas, land on barbarous coasts.

Do **NOT** use my solutions in graded assignments of any nature. Live or die, but don't poison everything.
